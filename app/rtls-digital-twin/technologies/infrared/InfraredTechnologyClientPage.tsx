          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Infrared (IR) technology for Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) utilizes invisible infrared light to
            determine the location of people and assets within indoor environments. Operating in the electromagnetic
            spectrum between visible light and radio waves (wavelengths from 780 nm to 1 mm), infrared systems provide
            reliable room-level or sub-room positioning with high accuracy in controlled environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            IR-based RTLS solutions are particularly valued for their precision in confined spaces, immunity to radio
            frequency interference, and inherent security due to the line-of-sight nature of infrared light. While not
            as widely deployed as RF-based technologies, infrared systems continue to serve important roles in
            healthcare, secure facilities, and other applications where reliable room-level presence detection is
            critical.

          <h2>How Infrared Works for RTLS</h2>
          <p>
            Infrared RTLS systems use various methods to determine the location of tags or badges within a facility.
            These approaches differ in their implementation, accuracy, and infrastructure requirements.
          </p>

          <div className="my-8">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Infrared Positioning Methods</h3>

              <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Active IR Beaconing</h4>
                <p>
                  In this approach, battery-powered IR tags or badges worn by personnel or attached to assets emit
                  unique infrared identification signals. Fixed IR receivers installed in rooms or areas detect these
                  signals and report the presence of specific tags to a central system. This method provides reliable
                  room-level accuracy and is commonly used in healthcare settings.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Passive IR Detection</h4>
                <p>
                  Fixed IR transmitters broadcast location codes within defined areas. Wearable badges or tags receive
                  these signals and report their location via a secondary communication channel (typically RF). This
                  approach reduces power consumption in the wearable device and can provide longer battery life.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">IR Triangulation</h4>
                <p>
                  Multiple IR receivers detect signals from a tag and measure signal characteristics to determine
                  position more precisely than simple presence detection. This method can achieve sub-meter accuracy in
                  well-designed environments but requires more infrastructure and careful calibration.

                  Combines infrared for precise room-level location with RF technologies (like Wi-Fi or BLE) for areas
                  where IR coverage is impractical. This approach leverages the strengths of both technologies: IR for
                  definitive room-level positioning and RF for broader coverage and communication.

          <h2>Infrared RTLS Architecture</h2>
          <p>A typical infrared-based RTLS system consists of the following components:</p>

          <div className="my-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">System Components</h3>
            <ul className="space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong>IR Tags/Badges:</strong> Wearable devices carried by personnel or attached to assets. These
                contain IR emitters (in active systems) or receivers (in passive systems), along with a unique
                identifier and potentially additional sensors. Many implementations include a secondary RF communication
                channel for data transmission beyond the IR range.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>IR Receivers/Sensors:</strong> Fixed devices installed in ceilings or walls that detect IR
                signals from tags. These are typically placed in each room or zone where tracking is required, with
                coverage patterns designed to ensure reliable detection throughout the space.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>IR Transmitters/Beacons:</strong> In passive systems, these fixed devices emit location-specific
                IR codes that are detected by tags. They are strategically placed to define specific zones or rooms
                within a facility.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Room Controllers/Collectors:</strong> Intermediate devices that aggregate data from multiple IR
                sensors in a room or zone and communicate with the central system. These often provide power and network
                connectivity to the IR sensors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Network Infrastructure:</strong> Wired or wireless connectivity that links the IR sensors and
                room controllers to the central server. This typically uses standard networking technologies like
                Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or proprietary protocols.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Location Engine:</strong> Software that processes IR detection events to determine and track the
                location of tags. In simple systems, this may just record room-level presence; in more advanced systems,
                it may calculate more precise positions within rooms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Management Platform:</strong> The user interface and business logic layer that turns location
                data into actionable information. This includes visualization, reporting, alerting, and integration with
                other business systems.
